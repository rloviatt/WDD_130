        Hi, my name is Russell Oviatt. I am from Star Valley, Wyoming. I am a CIT major and this is my fourth semester at BYU Idaho.

        I am not married but do have a girlfriend who also attends BYUI and is a psychology major, we've been dating for a little over 2 years.

        I have three siblings, two sisters and a brother. My two older siblings, one of the sisters and the brother, have both graduated college while my younger sister is still in high school.

        Outside of class I like to play video games, my favorite is probably Bloodborne and I am very much looking forward to Tears of the Kingdom. I play Overwatch 2 semi-regularly, and often lament the poor choices Blizzard has made continually over the lifetime of the game.

        I used to read a lot too, but haven't been able to find as much time for that hobby recently. Back when I did read more extensively it was mainly fantasy and science fiction. My favorite author is Robin Hobb specifically her books about FitzChivalry, I also like Brandon Sanderson (I'm one among many on that front) and Orson Scott Card although I've only read the books set in the Enderverse.
